# Building Basic Backends for Mobile Developers
## Using Django to create a backend from conception to deployment

### Setup Django Environment
Xcode and Android Studio provide visual tools that make creating new projects very simple. Most web frameworks don't have a visual editor or official IDE, which means setup is a bit more 'manual'. 

#### Python 3
Though most Macs include Python, it's usually an outdated version. For this workshop we're going to install Python 3. 

#### pip
Though Django can be installed by downloading it directly from its GitHub repo. This however is not the recommended installation method. Installing Django through Python's package manager (pip) ensures all dependencies are met and makes it easier to upgrade. Pip is included with Python 3. 

#### Virtual environment
Finally, it's recommended to use a virtual environment when setting up projects. This allows isolation of dependences to individual projects. The easiest virtual environment to use and install is virtualenv by the Python Packaging Authority. There are others that have more advanced features like [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) which manages Python installations.
