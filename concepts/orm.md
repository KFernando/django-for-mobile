# What is an ORM?

An Object-relational mapping on an abstract level is a technique for converting data between incompatible type. In web development, the term ORM almost synonymous with the tool that converts information from a database into native objects. The ORM generates SQL (or other database query code) automatically based on what methods are called on objects.  

The advantages of using an ORM is that they abstract away the underlying database.  This means that the same web application can be deployed using different database implmentations (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc) or even different database types (document stores, relational databases, graph databases). ORMs make creating applications fast and require only one programming language. Other advantages include not having to write any SQL, creating complex and multitable queries with ease, performance optimizations and lazy loading (though not all ORMs do this). 

The biggest disadvantage of using an ORM can be performance. Since the ORM is a generic solution and is generically mapping code to queries which can very easily produce inefficient queries. The other major performance problem with ORMs is that they make it simple to do things that would be difficult if dealing directly with the underlying datastore, this and the developer not understanding the underlying datastore can be a major factor in poor performance. There are some very legitimate arguments against using ORMS, see [OrmHate](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html), [ORM is an anti-pattern](http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/orm_is_an_antipattern), [The Vietnam of Computer Science](http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/), [ORM is an Offensive Anti-Pattern](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html) 

The Django ORM is powerful, includes lazy loading, included support for a wide range of relational database management systems (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), the ability to use third party databases (SAP SQL Anywhere, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Firebird, ODBC) and even the ability to use other database types (document stores (Mongo), graph databases (neo4j)).

The equivalent for iOS development is Core Data. The equivalent for Android development would be [Realm](https://realm.io/news/realm-for-android/) or [Sugar ORM](http://satyan.github.io/sugar/).
